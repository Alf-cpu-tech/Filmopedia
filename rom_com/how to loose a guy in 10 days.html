     <p>The romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days revolves around magazine writer Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) and advertising executive Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey).
        Andie begins seeing a man with the intention of chasing him away in ten days since she is writing an article about all the faults women make in relationships. 
         In the meantime, Ben wagers that he can win a large advertising account by making any woman fall in love with him in ten days.  They start their amusing game of romantic sabotage when they first meet, neither of them knowing the other's secret goal.As they both try to outwit the other—Andie by acting clingy and bizarre, and Ben by sticking around no matter what—they unexpectedly fall for each other. The truth eventually comes out, leading to a dramatic split, but of course, they reunite in classic rom-com fashion.
