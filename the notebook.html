    <p>The Notebook is a romantic drama movie that is based on the book by Nicholas Sparks.  In the 1940s, two young lovers from disparate social backgrounds—Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton—fall profoundly in love.  Allie's affluent parents and social constraints keep them apart despite their passionate summer relationship.
        Allie watches a newspaper article about Noah fixing a house he had promised to renovate for her years later, after she has gotten engaged to another guy.  Their love is reignited when she pays him a visit.  Allie, who is torn between her first love and her fiancé, finally decides on Noah.
        The story is framed by an elderly man reading this tale from a notebook to a woman in a nursing home—revealed to be Noah and Allie in their old age. Allie suffers from dementia, and Noah reads to her daily in hopes of helping her remember their love story.
