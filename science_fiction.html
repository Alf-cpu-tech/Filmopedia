      <p>
        Science fiction to me is the a philosophy of writing which asks could this be plausible given a indeterminate
        period of
        time of human advancement and change given these circumstances, with a heavy caveat of the rule of cool applied
        to it.
        Meaning that as long as something is interesting and or appealing enough in media we are willing so suspend our
        disbelief because believing is more fun. As science fiction is the abstract grouping of lots of works of media
        in many
        forms be they written or film based, there is many definitions that can be applied and it is less about which
        one
        is
        correct or which film is truly a sci-fi movie as most movies encompass multiple genres anyway. It is more about
        does
        this film have the soul of sci-fi which to me has always been a genre that is captivating as it gets me to
        question my
        understandings and views.
